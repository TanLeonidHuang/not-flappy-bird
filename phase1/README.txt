Our implementation of our game is NOT FULLY COMPLETE, and we understand we have much left to do for phase 2. Lindsey
suggested we just put something down that works and stress that we understand some things in our code may
violate CLEAN Architecture.

You can run our program by  running the main method in GameProgram.Main. This method calls the UI/Presenter from our
Login class, Menu class, and Countdown class. Once you run the method, you will be prompted to create an account or
login. Your account when you first run the program is not saved from the last time you logged in so make a new account
each time you run the program. We will have this solved by phase 2.

Once you log in, the game will prepare itself which cause the cursor to disappear on the terminal, not allowing you to
type again. Just click the terminal again to have to cursor pop up, so you can enter your menu option.

If you select option 1, the game itself will not run. Do not try to press the up and down keys to move the purple block.
It will not work. We have not yet connected the backend of our program to the GUI. However, a timer will be displayed
on the terminal that will stop when it reaches 10 letting you know the "game" is over, and you can then select another
option. Menu option 2 is an empty map since the game is not yet fully connected. Menu option 3 is a tutorial on how
our game will work.

To end the program, either click the game pop up X or click X on the terminal. Option 4 will log you out of your account.

This is a ROUGH draft of our main program, and due to people in our group dropping out of the course and family
emergencies, it was difficult to get this accomplished without taking too much time out of phase 2. We just would like
constructive criticism of this outline of our game for phase 2.
